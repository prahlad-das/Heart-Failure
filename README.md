# Heart-Failure

<p>This is a small data science project for beginners. Main goal of the project is to predict whether a patient will survive in case of heart attack. In our dataset we have information about patient's age, anaemia, creatinine, blood pressure, platelets etc. We have total 12 parameters of each patient. Our dataset is clean means we don't have missing values or NaN values in our dataset. We have splitted the dataset 80% for training and 20% for testing. </p>

We have tried different models for predictions. 
* Logistic Regression
* K Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Classification
* Naive Bayes
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest 
* XG Boost

<h3>Test accuracy for different models-</h3>
